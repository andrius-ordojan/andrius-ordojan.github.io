<h1>Bash script for streamlined addition of multiple public keys to remote servers</h1>

<p>The provided Bash script is designed to facilitate the addition of multiple SSH public keys to the authorized_keys file on a remote server. The PUBLIC_KEYS array contains individual strings, each representing a unique public key. The script establishes a connection to the remote server, iterates through the array, and appends each public key to the designated authorized_keys file. The user can customize the REMOTE_SERVER variable to specify the SSH username and IP address of the target server. Additionally, the script provides flexibility to include or remove public keys as needed, offering a straightforward solution for managing SSH access on a remote server.</p>

<pre>
    <code class="language-bash">
        #!/bin/bash

# Remote server details
REMOTE_SERVER="your_username@your_remote_server_ip"
AUTHORIZED_KEYS_FILE="$HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys"

# Public keys to be added
PUBLIC_KEYS=(
    "ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIEIzRXofDLn/YHzJOEyDnEOWGfx7dp3ephCTgbWPnzhF andrius.or@gmail.com"
    "more keys..."
)

# Loop through each public key and append it to the authorized_keys file on the remote server
for key in "${PUBLIC_KEYS[@]}"; do
    ssh "$REMOTE_SERVER" "echo '$key' >> $AUTHORIZED_KEYS_FILE"
done

# Display a message indicating success
echo "Public keys have been added to $REMOTE_SERVER:$AUTHORIZED_KEYS_FILE"
